## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Tailwind, EJS

In developing this web application, our primary emphasis was on functionality. This allowed us to focus on **CRUD** operations, data storage, and server-side logic while taking a utility-first approach to styling. 

We employed **MongoDB** to manage our JavaScript objects. Our database is structured with two collections: one for the users' meal plan and another for their grocery list. We enhanced our POST method by incorporating forms, aiming to produce well-organized documents.

By employing **‘async/await’**, we were able to streamline the handling of database queries, API requests, and enhance the overall readability and maintainability of our web application.

**Tailwind** proved to be a reliable tool in showcasing our initial MVP (Minimum Viable Product) so that users can begin establishing their weekly meals and grocery list while enjoying the aesthetic design.

## Lessons Learned:

Initially, we managed numerous PUT requests using forms. However, when shifting the focus to enhancing the user experience, we transitioned to handling these requests through JavaScript.

Additionally, we began by using 'parent-nodes' and 'child-nodes' to target elements in the DOM. However, this approach grew more complex and difficult to read in the codebase. Simplifying our strategy, we leveraged more classes on specified elements, resulting in significantly improved code readability.

## What we'd like to do:

We plan to incorporate authentication so that users can access their very own plans.
We plan to allow users to seamlessly connect their meals with the direct groceries needed.
We plan to enable users to be able to coordinate with other users.
We are continuing to improve the overall functionality, UX, and aesthetic for users to enjoy.
